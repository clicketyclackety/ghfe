# Gh-For-Everyone
Grasshopper for everyone! The Lazy Genius Way. Gh-For-Everyone was developed during the 2025 London AEC Tech hackathon organised by CORE studio/Thornton Tomasetti and hosted by Fosters + Partners as part of the Shape to Fabrication Conference.

Tired of explaining how to open a Grasshopper script for the 50th time? :cricket:
Wish your inputs magically turned into a usable UI without lifting a finger? :point_up:
You’re in the right place.

Welcome to **Gh-For-Everyone**, the *easiest*, *cleanest*, and *least soul-crushing* way to turn your Grasshopper scripts into real, usable interfaces. :hammer_and_wrench: Whether you’re building tools for teammates, clients, or that one coworker who still speaks about the "Grasshopper spaghetti", we’ve got you.

## Architecture
Gh-For-Everyone consist on a Rhino plugin that you can find in Food4Rhino, GitHub and the Rhino Package Manager.

## :dart: What It Does (aka Why You’ll Love It)
- :package: **Auto-Generates UI**: You already group and label your inputs like a civilized GH user, we take that and turn it into an interface. No extra components. No Remote Control Panels. No yak shaving.
- :arrows_counterclockwise: **Dynamic Inputs, Baby**: Change inputs on the fly. Reorganize. Rename. It just works™.
- :brain: **Zero Learning Curve**: If you can use Grasshopper and know what a “group” is, you’re 90% there.
- :sparkles: **Clean as a Whistle**: No clutter, no fiddly layout tools. Just the interface your script *wants* to be.

## :zap: Why Not Just Use [Insert Other Plugin Here]?
We love HumanUI, Synapse, Suimple, UI+, and all the great work out there. But sometimes, you just want to…

- Get a simple UI up and running in under 60 seconds.
- Avoid maintaining a second, custom UI every time you tweak your script.
- Let non-GH users run your logic without ever seeing the mess
- **Gh-For-Everyone** is your minimal-effort, maximum-impact solution.

## :wrench: Features
- Auto-parses inputs
- Supports multiple data types
- Live updates when you change stuff
- Custom labels and descriptions
- UI stays synced with your Grasshopper logic
- Probably more by the time you read this ~~(or probably not as this has been developed in 26 hours)~~

## :rocket: Getting Started
1. Open the Package Manager, search for "ghfe" and install it.
2. Group your inputs in your Grasshopper file.
3. Launch the Rhino Plugin and pick your grasshopper definition.
4. Bask in its glow.
5. That’s it.
6. Really, that's it.
7. No seriously, that’s it.

## :test_tube: Still a Prototype (But a Very Cool One)
This is an early version, expect a few quirks, weird behaviors, and missing polish. But also expect it to save you *loads* of time and sanity. We’re building this out with love (and caffeine) :coffee:. Your feedback, feature ideas, and bug reports are super welcome.

## :busts_in_silhouette: Who’s This For?
- Designers making tools for non-GH teammates
- Devs prototyping UI quickly
- Anyone who’s ever thought “There has to be an easier way…”
