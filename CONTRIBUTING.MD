# Welcome! :partying_face:

>First off, thank you for considering contributing to **Gh-For-Everyone!**. It's people like you that make the world a better place!

### Guidelines

>Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

## Ground Rules

> Responsibilities
> * Ensure that all code is made lovingly.
> * Create a discussion for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
> * Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
> * Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.

# Your First Contribution

> You may feel like the only productive contribution is `code`. But that's not true! Any and all engagement helps the project, so give yourself a little pat on the back ðŸ˜Š!
>
> Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
> Help wanted issues - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.
> Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.
